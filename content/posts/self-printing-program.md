I once wrote a program that printed itself. How did I do it? I don't remember,
the code is on my other computer. I promise to upload it here and make a better

Update: I found the code! I took the liberty of cleaning it up a bit and adding
a couple of features. You can find the code [here](https://github.com/ibice/go-print-file).
