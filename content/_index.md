### An introduction

Hi, this is Jorge and you're visiting my personal blog. Feel the power of the Internet ðŸŒŒ.
I intend to use this site as an excercise to write articles. Don't expect the themes to be consistent.
Hopefully you'll find something of your interest.

### About me!

I'm a computer engineer from Spain. I spend my working hours building a platform to manage Kubernetes clusters, in Kubernetes.
My users are Kubernetes administrators, and they provide managed cluster services to their customers. It's a fun role, it feels like
being in the Fellowship of the Rings of the Kubernetes projects, but without Gandalf. You get to learn all the magic tricks,
there's no magician guiding the quest.

During my years here I've been coding a lot. I feel pretty confortable in Bash and Python, but Go is my language of choice.
Leaving aside the coding adventures, I've been involved in continuous deployment, security, networking and observability projects. Pretty wide right?
Hopefully this blog will inspire me to write about the challenges we've overcome.

In my free time you'll find me climbing some rock in the mountain ranges in Spain (we have many!). I might as well be playing music with
my band or instrumenting my room to measure the temperature and humidity with a Raspberry Pico. I'll try to throw in a couple of posts about that.
