## University studies

![RFCAS](/img/rfcas.jpg)

I studied the **BSc in Telecommunications Engineering** at the Autonomous University of Madrid, where
I specialized in Communication Electronics.
On my [BSc thesis](http://rfcas.eps.uam.es/web/sites/default/files/trabajos_academicos/TFG1617-GITST-05-Jorge_CarpioLo%CC%81pezDeCastro.pdf) (only available in Spanish), I explored the possibilities of software-defined radio.

During my studies, I got an **Erasmus** mobility scholarship to spend the 2016/2017 academic year at the Politecnico di Milano.

## Languages

The languages I speak are:

- Spanish: mother tonge.
- English: C1 certified by Cambridge University.
- Italian: I lived one year in Milano, with italian people, eating italian food.
